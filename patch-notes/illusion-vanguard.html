                <p>Ever wonder how Warlords would look like with PvE? We humbly present to you our edition of Warlords
                    PvE.</p>
                <p>The following patch notes will provide a simple introduction to the various features introduced with
                    PvE. Further information on PvE can be found in the Warlords 2 PvE Documentation. You can navigate
                    the documentation using the sidebar to your left on desktop, or by using the hamburger on mobile
                    devices. (yes it sucks on mobile I know :shrug)</p>

                <div class="main-header"><span class="pn-header-text">NEW PvE Gamemode: Wave Defense</span></div>

                <p>Wave Defense is the first PvE gamemode released on Warlords 2. The main objective is to beat waves of
                    enemies by killing them all. </p>

                <p>To play the new gamemode, simply click the Wave Defense NPC in the front of the lobby to join a game.
                </p>

                <p>The maximum number of players is 4 per game, although you can play the game with less players. It is
                    highly suggested that you play the mode with 4 players.</p>

                <p>The new wave defense gamemode comes with 3 sub modes:</p>

                <p>
                    <span class="bold">Normal</span><br>
                    The normal mode comes with the most basic, classical experience. Survive 25 waves of onslaught from
                    the blighted mobs to secure your victory… for now.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <span class="bold">Hard </span><br>
                    The bosses have recuperated and are now back with a vengeance. Your objective is still to survive 25
                    waves, but mobs will now have 50% more HP, deal 50% mode damage, and have additional abilities.
                    <span class="bold">As this mode is still unpolished, we will be disabling it for now.</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="bold">Endless </span> <br>
                    With this gamemode, there is no end in sight. Kill as many enemies as you can to reach waves of mobs
                    that your fellow players have never seen before!
                </p>

                <p>Wave Defense features in-game upgrades, which are bought with Insignia obtained from killing mobs and
                    the end of rounds. More information can be found <a class='direlink'
                        href="/wave-defense/wave-defense.html">here</a>.</p>

                <p>When each game ends, you will be rewarded handsomely according to your performance. Rewards include
                    Coins, Guild Coins (if you’re in a guild), Spec/Class/Universal EXP and weapons. More information on
                    each item will be found below.</p>

                <div class="main-header"><span class="pn-header-text">New Maps</span></div>
                <br>
                <img src="crossfire.png" />
                <br>
                <br>
                <img src="rift.png" />

                <div class="main-header"><span class="pn-header-text">Masterworks Fair</span></div>

                <p>Ever get a great roll on a weapon but have no use for it? The Masterworks Fair is here to allow you
                    to flex your perfect common rolls and earn rewards for such perfection. </p>

                <p>The Masterworks Fair lasts a week and ends upon server reset every Monday. Participants compete by
                    trying to submit the weapon with the highest weapon score. There are three categories of weapons,
                    Common, Rare and Epic. Players can participate in all three categories at once. After the conclusion
                    of each Masterworks Fair, players earn rewards based on their weapon’s placement compared to other
                    players.</p>

                <div class="main-header"><span class="pn-header-text">Supply Drop Susan</span></div>
                <br>
                <div class="susan">
                    <img class="susan-gif" src="susan.gif" />
                    <img class="susan-static" src="susan.png" />
                </div>

                <p>Supply Drop Susan is essentially a lucky draw. You may roll rewards from Susan once per token. Tokens
                    are obtained as rewards from the Masterworks Fair, every 10 levels of Spec Rewards, and if you have
                    a ton of extra coins, you could purchase Susan tokens at 10k per token.</p>

                <div class="main-header"><span class="pn-header-text">Level Rewards</span></div>
                <br>
                <div class="level-rewards">
                    <img class="level-rewards-gif" src="level-rewards.gif" />
                    <img class="level-rewards-static" src="level-rewards.png" />
                </div>


                <p>You now can earn rewards while you level up your favorite specs! Rewards primarily consist of Coins
                    and Synthetic Shards, but occasionally you will be rewarded with Fairy Essence and Susan tokens too.
                    Level Rewards can be accessed by clicking your skull in the 8th slot of your hotbar.</p>

                <div class="main-header"><span class="pn-header-text">Achievements</span></div>
                
                <p>Achievement hunters can rejoice, for that Achievements have finally arrived in Warlords 2. Truth be
                    told, we created some achievements for PvP but thought it wasn’t so suitable to be implemented
                    within competitive play as some people might throw for the achievements. We also wanted the
                    achievements out with public games release, but the ship had already sailed on that by the time we
                    came around with achievement ideas. With PvE, we have been given the perfect opportunity to release
                    achievements. </p>

                <p>There are two types of achievements, being challenge and tiered. Challenge achievements are generally
                    one-time endeavors while tiered achievements are based on cumulative stats. Certain challenge
                    achievements have their description obfuscated as a surprise for players, and their achievement
                    descriptions will be displayed once you unlock the achievement. Feel free to share the content of
                    hidden achievements once anyone has unlocked the achievement.</p>

                <p>We anticipate further refining the concept of achievements in the future, so stay tuned on this!</p>

                <div class="main-header"><span class="pn-header-text">Weapons</span></div>
                
                <span class="bold">Obtaining Weapons</span>

                <p>Weapons are dropped randomly by mobs. Only common, rare and epic weapons can be dropped by mobs.
                    Mob-dropped weapons have randomized stats and therefore have a weapon score. </p>

                <p>Legendary weapons are craft/redeemed only and have fixed stats. Titles can be applied to legendary
                    weapons to modify their stat distribution.</p>

                <span class="bold">Synthetic Shards</span>

                <p>This is the basic currency for upgrading weapons. Salvaging weapons will award Synthetic Shards.
                    Synthetic Shards are the main cost for upgrading weapons.</p>

                <span class="bold">Legend Fragments</span>

                <p>Legend Fragments are needed to upgrade your legendary weapon. You can accumulate legend fragments by
                    playing games with your legendary weapon equipped. </p>

                <span class="bold">Star Pieces</span>

                <p>Star Pieces can be applied on legendary weapons to upgrade a singular, random stat by 20%/30%/40%,
                    depending on if the star piece is Common/Rare/Epic. Star Pieces are consumables and will be
                    destroyed upon usage. You can apply a star piece on a weapon that already has a stat boosted. This
                    will reroll the stat that the Star Piece boosts.</p>

                <p>Star Pieces are mainly obtained as a reward for placing in the top 3 in the Masterworks Fair, more
                    details on this right below. If you’re lucky, you could also get Star Pieces from Susan!</p>

                <div class="main-header"><span class="pn-header-text">Guilds</span></div>

                <p>Players can create a guild by paying 500k coins as long as they clear any PvE mode (Normal + Hard) 20
                    times. Guilds offer some amazing perks that can help boost the quality of gameplay and speed up your
                    progression. We will likely have guild-based events in the near future, so stay tuned!</p>

                <div class="main-header"><span class="pn-header-text">Currency</span></div>
                
                <span class="bold">Coins</span>

                <p>Coins are the generic currency for PvE in Warlords 2 and are involved in many transactions within
                    PvE. Coins will be rewarded after the completion of every game. Coins can also be obtained from
                    leveling rewards, which you can read about further down this document. </p>

                <span class="bold">Guild Coins</span>

                <p>Guild coins are earned if you are in a guild. You will be awarded a base of 2% of your coin gain per
                    game as Guild coins. Guild coins can be used to purchase temporary and permanent upgrades. Active
                    upgrades will boost all members currently in the guild. You can explore guild upgrade options in /g
                    menu while you’re in a guild.</p>

                <span class="bold">Fairy Essence</span>

                <p>Fairy Essence is used to unlock weapon skins. Once a weapon skin is unlocked, you can pick that skin
                    with no additional cost in the future even if you swap it off. If you’re in dire need of Fairy
                    Essence, consider subscribing to our Patreon… or… consult Susan??</p>
